ID mapping (aka Burner ID's)

Intent-filters VIEW and NDEF_DISCOVERED are not tight to timur.mobi 
anymore. WebCall links + NFC-connect now work with any hostname you
may be using.

Menu item 'Clear cache' can be invoked at any time to fetch the latest
WebCall core client. No need to exit app anymore for this purpose.

WebCall Update Page is now shown in-app (in iframe).

Dial-ID can now be used to call users on other WebCall servers.
This is running the caller widget from the other server in an iframe.

Fix: Improved reconnect stability when service is started by boot.

Fix: [Go Offline] does now stop service reconnecter immediately and 
more reliably.
