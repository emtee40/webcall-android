ID mapping (aka Burner ID's)
[link]

Dial-ID can now be used to call users on remote WebCall servers.
Missed calls and contacts will show remote user as 'id@domain'.
The caller-widget for a remote server is run in a separate,
secondary webview.

Intent-filters VIEW and NDEF_DISCOVERED are not tight to timur.mobi 
anymore. WebCall links + NFC-connect do now work with any hostname
you may be using. This means that if you can click on a link like:
https://somename.com/user/12345678901 and WebCall for Android will 
take care of it and let you call this id - as long as the link 
contains "/user/" in the middle.

New menu item 'Clear cache' can be used to update to the latest
WebCall core client, without a need to exit the app.

WebCall News [!] (aka Update Page) will now be shown in-app.

Fixed an issue where the reconnecter was not 100% stable when the 
service was started by the boot process.

On complete network loss you will now see 'No network. Reconnect paused.' 
(instead of 'No network. Giving up.') The service will reconnect as soon 
as some network is available again, but will not attempt to reconnect
while there is no network.

Fix: When you hit [Go Offline] the service reconnecter will stop 
immediately and reconnecter will stay completely off.
