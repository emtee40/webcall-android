Release notes

v1.1.5 and v1.1.6:

You can now swipe-kill WebCall activity and continue to receive 
calls. With the activity unloaded, memory consumption will be cut 
in half.

On Android 10+ the notification bubble will now show the caller
text message.

Handling of incoming calls for Android 10+ has been partly re-
implemented. The goal was to make the implementation more robust.

WebCall on Android 10+ is now using separate audio channels for 
ringtone and in-call audio. This way, the volume levels for ring 
(alarm) and voice can be adjusted individually.

v1.1.4:

Fixed NPE in dialId() url.getQuery()

In onServiceConnected() if not on mainpage do not clr dialIdIntent

v1.1.3:

When screen is off, low-priority notifications are now suppressed.
Only incoming calls and "Failed to connect" will be reported.

File download and APK installation/upgrade now supported in-app.

Widgets that require connectivity (Contacts, Dial-ID, ID-Manager, 
etc.) cannot be opened anymore when no network is available.

Resolved an issue on Android 12: The app now makes sure that the 
caller widget is always executed in an isolated webview (and is not 
unintentionally opened in an external browser).

v1.1.2:

When switching to offline mode, the status info in the Android 
notification tray will now show "Offline". In v1.1.0 the most recent 
status message stayed visible.

On the base page, when changing the "Server address" (say, from 
timur.mobi to xyz.com) and tapping on "Get new ID", the new server 
address is now stored persistently. This does not happen in version 
v1.1.0, so that on next start the app will try to connect to the old 
server address. 

v1.1.0:

ID Manager lets you register multiple user-ID's and operate them all
in parallel. #BurnerPhone #BurnerIDs
See: https://timur.mobi/webcall/more/#id-manager

Accept or Deny incoming calls directly from a popup notification on 
Android 10+.

You can now capture and view WebCall logs on Android 10+.

New [Clear cache] option lets you update the WebCall core client,
without having to exit the app.

Federated WebCall allows many WebCall servers to work together,
without data synchronization and without operator consultation.
Call-widgets from remote servers are run inside isolated webview 
instances. Incoming calls, missed calls and contacts now show
remote user as: id@domain.

WebCall links + NFC connect are not anymore tight to timur.mobi
domain. Both will work with any domain you may run across. You
can click on links like: https://(domain)/user/(id) and WebCall 
for Android will let you call this party right away. 

WebCall for Android now brings up the Android soft keyboard when 
needed, without you having to explicity tap the form field.

WebCall for Android comes with a refreshed base page, offering
many small improvements.

WebCall Update is now being shown inside the app. No need to start
an external browser for this.

Issues resolved:

Reconnecter is now more resiliant, for instance when WebCall service
was started during boot.

On network loss you will now see 'No network. Reconnect paused.'
(instead of 'No network. Giving up.'). Client will try to reconnect
as soon as a network becomes available again, but will not attempt
to reconnect while there is no network.

An issue related to sending files was solved (on Android 9+ devices).

When you click [Go Offline], the reconnecter service will stop right
away and stay fully inactive until you [Go Online] again.

Fixed an issue with the proximity sensor on some smartphone devices.

Fixed an issue where 'Screen for wifi' could not be disabled on some
older devices.
