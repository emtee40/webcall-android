ID mapping (aka Burner ID's)

Dial-ID can now be used to call users on remote WebCall servers.
Caller-widgets for remote servers are now run in a separate webview.
Missed calls will show remote host user as 'id@domain'.

Intent-filters VIEW and NDEF_DISCOVERED are not tight to timur.mobi 
anymore. WebCall links + NFC-connect do now work with any hostname
you may be using.

New menu item 'Clear cache' can be invoked to update to the latest
WebCall core client, without being required to exit app.

WebCall News [!] (aka Update Page) is now shown in-app.

Fix: Improved reconnect stability when service is started during boot.

Fix: [Go Offline] does now stop service reconnecter immediately and 
more reliably.
