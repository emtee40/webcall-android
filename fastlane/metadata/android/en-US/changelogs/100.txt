ID Manager
See: https://timur.mobi/webcall/more/#id-manager

Federated WebCall server support: Dial-ID can now be used to call
users on remote WebCall servers. Call-widgets from remote servers are
now run in a separate webview. Incoming calls, missed calls and 
Contacts do now show remote user as: id@hostaddress.

Intent-filters VIEW and NDEF_DISCOVERED are not anymore tight to the 
timur.mobi domain. WebCall links + NFC-connect do now work with any 
hostname that your WebCall server may be using. You can click on a link
such as: https://sample.com/user/12345678901 and WebCall for Android 
will handle it for you, by letting you call this ID. All that is needed
for this to work, is for the link to contain "/user/" in the middle.

New menu item 'Clear cache' can be used to update to the latest
WebCall core client, without a need to exit the app.

WebCall for Android can now force the Android soft keyboard to open
without an explicit user tap.

WebCall News [!] will now be shown in-app.

Issues fixed:

Reconnecter is more reliable, im particular when WebCall service 
was started by the boot process.

On complete network loss you will now see 'No network. Reconnect paused.' 
(instead of 'No network. Giving up.') The service will reconnect as soon 
as a network becomes available again, but will not attempt to reconnect
while there is no network.

When you click [Go Offline] the service reconnecter will stop 
immediately and will stay completely inactive until you hit [Go Online].

Fixed an edge-case issue with the proximity sensor on smartphone devices.
