ID Manager

Federated WebCall server: Dial-ID can now be used to call users on 
remote WebCall servers. Call-widgets from remote servers are run in 
an isolated webview instance. Incoming calls, missed calls and 
Contacts will now show remote user as: id@hostaddress.

WebCall links + NFC-connect are not anymore tight to the timur.mobi 
domain. Both will work with any domain name you may run across. You 
can click on a link such as: https://sample.com/user/12345678901
and WebCall for Android will handle it for you, by letting you make
a call right away. All that is needed for this to work, is for the 
link to contain "/user/" in the middle.

The new 'Clear cache' feature in the pulldown menu can be used to 
update the WebCall core client, without a need to exit the app.

WebCall for Android can now make the Android soft keyboard show up,
without the user being required to explicity tap the input field.

WebCall News [!] will now be shown inside the app, without an external
browser being used.

Issues fixed:

Reconnecter is more reliable, im particular when WebCall service 
was started by the boot process.

On complete network loss you will now see 'No network. Reconnect paused.' 
(instead of 'No network. Giving up.') The service will reconnect as soon 
as a network becomes available again, but will not attempt to reconnect
while there is no network.

When you click [Go Offline] the service reconnecter will stop 
immediately and will stay completely inactive until you hit [Go Online].

Fixed an edge-case issue with the proximity sensor on smartphone devices.

Screen for wifi could not be disabled on some devices. This has been fixed.
