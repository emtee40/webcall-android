ID Manager
See: https://timur.mobi/webcall/more/#id-manager

Enhanced support for federated WebCall servers.
Dial-ID can now be used to call users on remote WebCall servers.
The call-widget for a remote server is run in a secondary webview.
Missed calls and contacts now show remote user as 'id@hostaddress'.

Intent-filters VIEW and NDEF_DISCOVERED are not tight to timur.mobi 
anymore. WebCall links + NFC-connect do now work with any hostname
you may be using. This means that if you can click on a link like:
https://somename.com/user/12345678901 and WebCall for Android will 
take care of it and let you call this id - as long as the link 
contains "/user/" in the middle.

New menu item 'Clear cache' can be used to update to the latest
WebCall core client, without a need to exit the app.

WebCall for Android can now force the Android soft keyboard to open
without an explicit user tap.

WebCall News [!] will now be shown in-app.

Issues fixed:

Reconnecter is more reliable, im particular when WebCall service 
was started by the boot process.

On complete network loss you will now see 'No network. Reconnect paused.' 
(instead of 'No network. Giving up.') The service will reconnect as soon 
as a network becomes available again, but will not attempt to reconnect
while there is no network.

When you click [Go Offline] the service reconnecter will stop 
immediately and will stay completely inactive until you hit [Go Online].

Fixed an edge-case issue with the proximity sensor on smartphone devices.
