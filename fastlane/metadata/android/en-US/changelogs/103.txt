without data synchronization and without operator consultation.

WebCall links + NFC connect are not anymore tight to timur.mobi
domain. Both will work with any domain you may run across. You
can click on links like: https://(domain)/user/(id) and WebCall 
for Android will let you call this party right away. 

WebCall for Android now brings up the Android soft keyboard when 
needed, without you having to explicity tap the form field.

WebCall for Android comes with a refreshed base page, offering
many small improvements.

WebCall Update is now being shown inside the app. No need to start
an external browser for this.

Issues resolved:

Reconnecter is now more resiliant, for instance when WebCall service
was started during boot.

On network loss you will now see 'No network. Reconnect paused.'
(instead of 'No network. Giving up.'). Client will try to reconnect
as soon as a network becomes available again, but will not attempt
to reconnect while there is no network.

An issue related to sending files was solved (on Android 9+ devices).

When you click [Go Offline], the reconnecter service will stop right
away and stay fully inactive until you [Go Online] again.

Fixed an issue with the proximity sensor on some smartphone devices.

Fixed an issue where 'Screen for wifi' could not be disabled on some
older devices.
